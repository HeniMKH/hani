        Anthropology is the scientific study of humanity, concerned with human behavior, human biology, cultures, societies, and linguistics, in both the present and past, including past human species.[1][2][3] Social anthropology studies patterns of behaviour, while cultural anthropology[1][2][3] studies cultural meaning, including norms and values. A portmanteau sociocultural anthropology[4] is commonly used today. Linguistic anthropology studies how language influences social life. Biological or physical anthropology[1][2][3] studies the biological development of humans.

  Archaeological anthropology,[5][6] often termed as 'anthropology of the past', studies human activity through investigation of physical evidence. It is considered a branch of anthropology in North America and Asia, while in Europe archaeology is viewed as a discipline in its own right or grouped under other related disciplines, such as history.
